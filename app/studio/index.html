                  <p class="barry-first-paragraph">Barry began his landscape architecture career over 30 years ago in Central Florida. Having received his BLA from the University of Florida in 1985, he sought after a fully integrated understanding of the profession and spent much of his career working for leading multi-disciplinary design firms. It was with these experiences where he learned the value of a coordinated design effort with all design disciplines in developing buildable and lasting solutions.</p>

                  <p class="barry-second-paragraph">In the spring of 2011, Barry founded Land Resource Design Group. The establishment of the firm was inspired by his core belief of viewing land as an extremely valuable resource. Barry works closely with his clients and leadership team to collaborate with other design disciplines in providing thoughtful design, carefully crafted execution, and timeless value in the communities they create. Over the years, he has had the privilege to work with award-wining master-planned community developers, leading national builders, industry-leading multi-family developers and world leaders in theme park entertainment.</p>

                  <p class="barry-third-paragraph">Barry loves his role as husband and father to his wife of thirty years and his three talented and now adult children. In his spare time, he is a big sports fan, enjoys managing his daughter’s golf career and serving up some tasty BBQ from his prized Big Green Egg.</p>
